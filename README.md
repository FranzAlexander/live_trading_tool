Project Overview
Status: Discontinued

This project is a Tauri and SvelteKit-based application designed to interact with the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. It demonstrates the capability to connect to the Kraken HTTP API and establish a sustained WebSocket connection for real-time data streaming.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Key Features:

Backend Integration: Developed in Rust, the backend handles data processing and includes various technical analysis indicators.

Frontend Visualization: Utilizes the lightweight-charts library to dynamically display data on the frontend, providing an interactive interface for cryptocurrency analysis.

WebSocket Connectivity: Ensures a stable WebSocket connection with Kraken for real-time, accurate data feeds.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose and Scope:

The application's primary function is to display three types of charts: a range bar chart, a one-minute chart, and a five-minute chart, enhanced with built-in indicators for analyzing cryptocurrency trends.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Technologies Used:

Frontend: SvelteKit

Backend: Rust (Tauri Framework)

Data Visualization: Lightweight-Charts Library

API Integration: Kraken HTTP and WebSocket APIs

--------------------------------------------------------------

Challenges and Learning Outcomes:

WebSocket Integration: Overcoming the initial challenge of integrating the Kraken async WebSocket within the Tauri environment was a key learning experience, enhancing my understanding of asynchronous programming and API integration in Rust.
